# 🍬 Candy Crush Clone  

This is my **Programming Fundamentals Semester Project**, where I created a simple Candy Crush clone using **SFML**. It was an exciting journey that helped me learn about 2D arrays, SFML objects, and the basics of game development!

## ✨ Features  
- **Swap and match candies** in a grid-based layout.  
- Dynamic **score system** for matches.  
- Basic **main menu interface** built with SFML.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Language:** C++  
- **Framework:** SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)

## 📚 What I Learned  
- Manipulating **2D arrays** for game logic.  
- Using **SFML objects** like `Texture`, `Sprite`, and `Window`.  
- Creating and managing a **main menu**.
